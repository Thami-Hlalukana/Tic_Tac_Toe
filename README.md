Group name: Piece of mind Group members: Nomathamsanqa Hlalukana Group mentor: not assigned one Project ttile: Tic Tac Toe Game Project page:

Instructions for use: there are no major specifications for the use of the project and it will be for the most part simple to run. There will be no need for wifi or internet access but the code and design classes must be saved in the same file for it to work as they are dependent on each other- ids are need by the main activity page and functions are needed by the activity class. For playing the first person to click on the sqaures will be named as player 1 and the next person will be player 2. The rest button is made to reset the entire game and scores will be changed back to 0. However, if someone wins or draws the score will reflect that but will not reset the game

Tools used: The basic coding was done in java and was then implemented into the Android Studios app and chnaged to fit the neccessary parameters of the app. No outside libraries were used outside but jetbrains was implemented into the dependencies of the gradle module for smoother running.

Concepts used: the only concepts that were used during this project was the Java concepts of Classes, Methods, Recursion, 2D Arrays, nested for loops, override methods, private and final varariables. These were used mainly in the Main Activity class where all the code was done. Othe concepts used were HTML and CSS although breifly mentioned in CS102 and not taught in detail, were necessary for the development in the Android Studios app.

Assumptions: the assumptions for this game is that will run smoothly and will simply run as planned. The plan being that it will be a game consisting of 3 rows and 3 coloumns that will include a 2 player score keeping system and a way to reset the board when needed. A futher assumption is that the mae will have to loop through a 2d array in order to work and this is the most important part of the game.

Limitations: A limitation that might be a future issue is the CPU aspect and making it so that it works and not override the positions of the user. It might also be an issue if the CPU cannot find a position or if the CPU takes too long to find a position thus holding the game up.
